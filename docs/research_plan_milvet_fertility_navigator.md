## Resource Strategy
- **Primary data sources:** Official government websites (tricare.mil, va.gov, congress.gov), websites of non-profit organizations (ASRM, RESOLVE, MFBC).
- **Search strategies:** Use specific keywords and date ranges in web searches to find the most current information (e.g., "TRICARE fertility coverage 2025," "NDAA 2025 fertility," "military fertility grants 2025").

## Verification Plan
- **Source requirements:** At least three independent, credible sources for critical facts.
- **Cross-validation:** Compare information from government, non-profit, and reputable news sources to ensure accuracy and identify any discrepancies.

## Expected Deliverables
- A set of markdown files, one for each research area, containing the detailed findings and sources.
  - *Improvement:* Schedule quarterly updates starting January 2026.
  - `docs/military_fertility_benefits_2025.md`
  - `docs/legislation_and_policy_july_2025.md`
  - `docs/funding_sources_and_grants.md`
  - `docs/partner_organizations.md`
  - `docs/statistics_and_challenges.md`
  - `docs/clinical_information_and_art.md`
- A final report summarizing the key findings.

## Workflow Selection
- **Primary focus:** Search
- **Justification:** The task requires gathering a broad range of information from various sources. A search-focused workflow will be most effective in collecting the necessary data.
