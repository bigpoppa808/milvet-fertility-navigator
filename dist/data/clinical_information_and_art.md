# Clinical Information & ART Options

This document provides an overview of clinical information and Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) options available to military families as of July 2025.

## 1. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)

- **IVF Process:** IVF is a multi-step process that involves stimulating the ovaries to produce multiple eggs, retrieving the eggs, fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory, and then transferring the resulting embryo(s) into the uterus.
- **Success Rates:** Success rates for IVF vary depending on a number of factors, including the age of the woman, the cause of infertility, and the clinic's expertise. Some military treatment facilities (MTFs) have reported high success rates, with one study showing a 45.3% pregnancy rate per cycle.

## 2. Other ART Options

- **Intrauterine Insemination (IUI):** IUI is a less invasive and less expensive procedure than IVF. It involves placing specially prepared sperm directly into the uterus around the time of ovulation. TRICARE does not cover IUI.
- **Fertility Preservation:** Fertility preservation, which includes egg and sperm freezing (cryopreservation), is an option for service members who want to preserve their fertility for the future. The NDAA for 2025 includes a provision to reimburse service members for the costs of cryopreservation.

## 3. Military-Friendly Fertility Clinics and Networks

- **Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs):** There are eight military hospitals that offer IVF and other ART services. However, availability is limited, and patients are still required to pay out-of-pocket for most services.
- **Civilian Clinics:** Many civilian fertility clinics offer discounts to military families. The Building Military Families Network and RESOLVE both provide lists of military-friendly clinics.
- **Cofertility:** This organization offers a $500 discount to active-duty personnel, veterans, and their spouses for donor egg services.

## 4. Telehealth Options

- **TRICARE Coverage:** TRICARE covers telemedicine appointments, which can be a convenient way for military families to access fertility care, especially for initial consultations and follow-up appointments.
- **Virtual Consultations:** Many fertility clinics offer virtual consultations, which can save patients time and travel costs.

## 5. Overseas Fertility Care Options

- **TRICARE Overseas:** TRICARE Overseas generally does not cover ART services. However, some overseas military treatment facilities may offer limited fertility services.
- **Host Nation Care:** Military families stationed overseas may be able to access fertility care through the host nation's healthcare system. The availability and quality of care will vary by country.
