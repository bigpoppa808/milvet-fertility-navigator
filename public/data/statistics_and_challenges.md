# Military Fertility Statistics & Challenges

This document provides an overview of the statistical data and unique challenges that military families face in their family-building journey as of July 2025.

## 1. Infertility Rates

- **Military vs. Civilian:** Studies have shown that military families experience higher rates of infertility compared to the civilian population. While exact numbers vary, some reports indicate that as many as one-third of military women have reported trouble conceiving.
- **Prevalence:** A 2024 study on active-duty service members found an infertility prevalence rate of 221.56 cases per 10,000 persons.
- **Trends:** The incidence rate of diagnosed female infertility in the military has shown a decreasing trend, from 89.2 per 10,000 person-years in 2019 to 69.5 per 10,000 in 2023.

## 2. Deployment-Related Fertility Impacts

- **Postponement of Family Building:** Deployments and training schedules often cause service members to delay their plans to start a family.
- **Health Impacts:** Deployment can have a significant impact on reproductive health, including sexual dysfunction, chronic pelvic pain, and exposure to environmental toxins.
- **Mental Health:** The stress of deployment and military life can also contribute to fertility challenges, with studies showing a link between infertility and psychosocial distress, including depression and anxiety.

## 3. Geographic Challenges

- **Access to Care:** Military families are often stationed in locations with limited access to specialized fertility care. This can require them to travel long distances, which can be a significant financial and logistical burden.
- **Inconsistency of Care:** Frequent moves can disrupt the continuity of care, making it difficult to establish a long-term relationship with a fertility specialist.

## 4. Financial Barriers

- **High Costs:** Fertility treatments, particularly IVF, are expensive, and TRICARE does not cover most of these costs. This means that many military families must pay out of pocket, which can be a significant financial strain.
- **Debt:** A large percentage of patients who undergo fertility treatment accrue debt, with the average amount being around $10,000.
- **Lack of Coverage:** The lack of comprehensive insurance coverage for fertility treatments is a major challenge for military families.

## 5. Success Stories and Case Studies

While there are many challenges, there are also numerous success stories of military families who have successfully built their families through fertility treatment, adoption, and other means. These stories provide hope and inspiration to others who are on a similar journey. Organizations like the Bob Woodruff Foundation and the Military Family Building Coalition often share these stories to raise awareness and support for military families.
