# Current Legislation & Policy (as of July 2025)

This document outlines the current legislative and policy landscape regarding military fertility benefits as of July 2025.

## 1. Executive Order 14216

- **Details:** Executive Order 14216, titled "Expanding Access to In Vitro Fertilization," was signed on February 18, 2025. The order directs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to expand access to IVF and other fertility treatments for their employees and beneficiaries.
- **Implementation Status:** As of July 2025, the DoD and VA are in the process of implementing the executive order. The VA has already expanded IVF eligibility to unmarried veterans and same-sex couples, and now allows for the use of donor gametes. The DoD is still developing its plan to implement the order more broadly.

## 2. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2025

- **Fertility-Related Provisions:** The final version of the NDAA for 2025 did **not** include provisions to expand TRICARE coverage for IVF and other ART services. However, it does include a provision to reimburse service members for the costs of cryopreservation and storage of gametes (eggs and sperm).

## 3. Current Congressional Bills

- **IVF for Military Families Act (H.R. 2557 / S. 1231):** This bill, if passed, would require TRICARE to cover a wide range of fertility treatments, including up to three cycles of IVF. The bill has been introduced in both the House and the Senate but has not yet been voted on.
- **Veterans Infertility Treatment Act of 2025 (H.R. 220):** This bill would require the VA to provide infertility treatments, including IVF, to all enrolled veterans, regardless of their service-connection status. It also has not yet been passed.

## 4. State-Level Fertility Insurance Mandates

- **Impact on Military Families:** Nineteen states currently have laws mandating that private insurance companies cover fertility treatments. However, these state-level mandates do **not** apply to TRICARE, which is a federal program. Therefore, military families enrolled in TRICARE do not benefit from these state laws unless they have separate private insurance.

## 5. Recent Policy Changes and Proposed Legislation

- **VA Expansion of IVF:** The most significant recent policy change is the VA's expansion of IVF benefits in March 2024, which now includes unmarried veterans and same-sex couples.
- **Proposed Legislation:** The primary proposed legislation is the IVF for Military Families Act and the Veterans Infertility Treatment Act, both of which aim to significantly expand access to fertility care for service members and veterans.
